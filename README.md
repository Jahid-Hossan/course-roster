<!-- How I managed the state in my assignment project. -->
I have used multiple state in my assignment for store some values. For some state I used Empty array and for some I use number based on what I need actually. For example, electedCourse,creditHour, totalCreditHour, and much more state I used. I update the value using set function. And I pass Those state value through jsx markup as props to another component and I received those value using parameter. Basically I used state for set and update The data. This way actually I managed state in my assignment project.This way actually I managed state in my assignment project.
